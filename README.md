aMule Remote for Android

This is the source code for the Android application 
[aMule Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iukonline.amule.android.amuleremote).
aMule Remote used to be closed source, but I'm now publishing the code under
GNU GPL License.

The source code published here contains several enhancements, a GUI refactoring,
and some bug fixes, that have never been published on Play Store, due to
lack of time on my side.
